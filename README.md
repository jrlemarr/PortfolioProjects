### Business Analytics Portfolio Project Repository

A portfolio of all the projects I have done regarding data analytics skills; this repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects I have created, either on my own or as part of team projects. Please feel free to take these and run with them. Edit them, transform them, make them your own, and find your insights and truths. I hope this serves as a neat guideline to anyone new to data analytics and looking to dip their toes in the waters of data science. More importantly, this repository can help you in your personal and professional journey!

## [Project 1: Improving the Safety of Driving in MA using SQL](https://github.com/jrlemarr/BA775_Project/blob/main/Team%20Assignment-Team-6.ipynb)
- Background: While car crashes seem like an inevitable part of driving, the consequences of accidents can be devastating. Our team aimed to analyze the data provided on car crashes to see if anything could be done to prevent such accidents and hoped this would help prevent more severe accidents. In addition, since COVID-19 was a large force in our lives at the time, we wanted to see if the pandemic affected the number of accidents. We found some insightful answers about what conditions accidents are happening in and provided meaningful suggestions to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation that may help create a safer driving environment.
- Objective: Our project focuses on helping the Massachusetts Department of Transportation analyze car accidents. We examined the relationship between the frequency and severity of car accidents in relation to various factors, for example, time period, road sections, weather conditions, and locations. We delved into the patterns of car crashes in Massachusetts and what actions could be taken by the massDOT to prevent crashes in the future. In addition, we joined our data with a COVID-19 dataset to find out the influence of COVID-19 on car crashes. After our analysis, we made suggestions to the massDOT on ways to prevent accidents based on our conclusions.

## [Project 2: HR Analytics: Job Attrition in Data Scientists](https://github.com/jrlemarr/BA780_Project/blob/main/BA780%20Deliverable%20Finalization.pdf)
- Background: A company that is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who received training. "Company" wants to analyze the factors affecting candidates' decision to stay or look for a new job after training.
- Objective: The project goal is to predict whether a data scientist candidate will look for new employment or wants to work for the company after training, which helps optimize HR costs and increase efficiencies. Using descriptive and predictive analysis of a company's HR dataset, we seek to interpret affecting factors on employee decisions.

## Project 3: Predicting Members Most Likely Resistant to the COVID Vaccination
- Background/Objective: The project aimed to predict Humana members most likely resistant to the COVID vaccination. The data collected by the insurance company, Humana, included 367 features. In addition, we performed exploratory data analysis and cleaning and implemented LightGBM, Random Forest, and XGBoost models to predict hesitant Humana members. Finally, based on data insights, we recommended targeted plans to drive vaccination among the sub-segments of reluctant members. More detailed information regarding the project is confidential due to the nature of the company.

## [Project 4: Drought Impact on Maple Syrup Production](https://github.com/jrlemarr/Capstone_Project/blob/main/Team%20B4%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf)
- Background: Maple and the maple industry are synonymous with the New England region's sugar houses and mountainsides with colorful leaves in the fall. The economic value of maple syrup hit $130 million back in 2015. However, the growth of maple trees and maple syrup production is sensitive to climate change. One main concern for maple tree growers and maple syrup producers is the impact of warming spring temperatures during the critical sugaring period and the increase in summer drought frequencies, affecting the maple syrup yield and the sugar content of maple products. Therefore, understanding how climate changes and other factors may impact this resource is essential to continue the management of the maple industry into the future.
- Objective: This project aims to determine how drought and precipitation factors affect maple syrup production in gallons. Our primary focus will be on the Northeast region, precisely seven states, including Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. The New England region is well known for its maple syrup production, and hence we will delve deeper into that area. We will analyze variables such as maple syrup's annual crop production and other climate change parameters. Furthermore, this report will further explain the impact of drought on maple tree production.

## [Project 5: Analyzing the Impact of Education on Voter Turnout in MA & NY Counties](https://github.com/jrlemarr/IS843_Project/blob/main/Analyzing_impact_of_education_on_voter_turnout.pdf)
- Background/Objective: This project aims to shed some light on the disparity between voter turnout and education level. Using Big Data tools, our team determined voter turnout disparity between households who have completed varying degrees of education.

## [Project 6: Financial and Accounting Analytics of Stock Returns During Market Shock of Early 2022](https://github.com/jrlemarr/BA870/blob/main/BA870%20Project%20-%20Jacinto%20Lemarroy.pdf)
- Background/Objective: As part of a financial analysis project, I conducted an in-depth study of the Russell 3000 index stock returns. This index measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, representing around 97% of the investable U.S. equity market. The study was conducted using a sample of data from a large set of U.S. companies during the "Stock Market Shock" of early 2022. By analyzing this data, I gained valuable insights into the behavior of the U.S. equity market during times of extreme volatility and was able to draw conclusions about how investors can best navigate these conditions.
