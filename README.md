### Business Analytics Portfolio Project Repository

A portfolio of all the projects I have done regarding data analytics skills; this repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects I have created, either on my own or as part of team projects. Please feel free to take these and run with them. Edit them, transform them, make them your own, and find your insights and truths. I hope this serves as a neat guideline to anyone new to data analytics and looking to dip their toes in the waters of data science. More importantly, I hope this repository can help you in your personal and professional journey!

## [Project 1: Improving the Safety of Driving in MA using SQL](https://github.com/jrlemarr/BA775_Project/blob/main/Team%20Assignment-Team-6.ipynb)
- Background: Car crashes seem like an inevitable part of being a driver, but the consequences of them can be devastating. Since we are studying - or will by studying- in Massachusetts, we focused our analysis here. We wanted to analyze the data provided on car crashes to see if there was anything that could be done to prevent such accidents from occur, and hoped this would especially help prevent more severe accidents, where traffic is delayed for long periods of time which could also mean more serious injuries. Since COVID has been a large force in our lives lately, we also wanted to see if it affected the number of accidents. We were able to find some insightful answers as to what conditions accidents are happening in, and provide meaningful suggestions to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation that may help to create a safer driving environment.
- Objective: Our project focuses on helping the Massachusetts Department of Transportation analyze car accidents. We will analyze the relationship between the frequency and severity of car accidents in relation to various factors, for example time period, road sections, weather conditions and locations. We will try to understand the patterns of car crashes in Massachusetts and what actions could be taken by the massDOT to prevent crashes in the future. In addition, we have joined our data with a Covid dataset to find out the influence of Covid on car crashes. After our analysis, suggestions could be made to the massDOT on ways to prevent accidents based on our conclusions.

## [Project 2: HR Analytics: Job Attrition in Data Scientists](https://github.com/jrlemarr/BA780_Project/blob/main/BA780%20Deliverable%20Finalization.pdf)
- Background: A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who received training. "Company" wants to analyze the factors affecting candiates' decision on staying or looking for a new job after training.
- Objective: The project goal is to predict whether a data scientist candidate will look for a new employment or wants to work for the company after training, which helps optimize HR costs and increase efficiencies. By using both descriptive and predictive analysis on a company’s HR dataset, we seek to interpret affecting factors on employee decisions.

## Project 3: Predicting Members Most Likely Resistant to the COVID Vaccination
- Background/Objective: The goal of the project was to predict Humana members most likely resistant to the COVID vaccination. Data collected was given by insurance company, Humana, including 367 features. We performed exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and implemented LightGBM, Random Forest, and XGBoost models to predict hesitant Humana members. Finally, we recommended targeted plans to drive vaccination among the sub-segments of hesitant members based on data insights. More detailed information regarding the project is confidential due to the nature of the company.

## [Project 4: Drought Impact on Maple Syrup Production](https://github.com/jrlemarr/Capstone_Project/blob/main/Team%20B4%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf)
- Background: Maple and the maple industry are synonymous with the New England region’s sugar houses and mountainsides with colorful leaves in the fall. The economic value of maple syrup hit $130 million back in 2015. However, the growth of maple trees and maple syrup production is sensitive to climate change. One main concern for maple tree growers and maple syrup producers is the impact of warming spring temperature during the critical sugaring period and increase in summer drought frequencies which affect the maple syrup yield and sugar content, and the flavor of maple products. Understanding how climate changes and other factors may impact this resource is essential to continue the management of the maple industry into the future.
- Objective: This project aims to determine how maple syrup production in gallons is affected by drought and precipitation factors. Our primary focus will be on the Northeast region, precisely seven states, including Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. The New England region is well known for its maple syrup production, and hence we will delve deeper into that area. We will analyze variables such as the annual crop production of maple syrup and other parameters related to climate change. Furthermore, this report will further explain the impact of drought on maple tree production.

## [Project 5: Analyzing the Impact of Education on Voter Turnout in MA & NY Counties](https://github.com/jrlemarr/IS843_Project/blob/main/Analyzing_impact_of_education_on_voter_turnout.pdf)
- Background/Objective: This project aims at shedding some light on the issue of disparity between voter turnout and education level. Using Big Data tools, our team determined  voter turnout disparity between households who have completed varying degrees of education.

## [Project 6: Financial and Accounting Analytics of Stock Returns During Market Shock of Early 2022](https://github.com/jrlemarr/BA870/blob/main/BA870%20Project%20-%20Jacinto%20Lemarroy.pdf)
- Background/Objective: As part of a financial analysis project, I conducted an in-depth study of the Russell 3000 index stock returns. This index measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, representing around 97% of the investable U.S. equity market. The study was conducted using a sample of data from a large set of U.S. companies during the "Stock Market Shock" of early 2022. By analyzing this data, I gained valuable insights into the behavior of the U.S. equity market during times of extreme volatility, and was able to draw conclusions about how investors can best navigate these conditions.
