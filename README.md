### Business Analytics Portfolio Project Repository

A portfolio of all the projects I have done in regards to data analytics skills.
This repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects I have created, either on my own or as part of team projects.
Please feel free to take these and run with them. Edit them, transform them, make them your own and find your insights and truths.
I hope this serves as a neat guideline to anyone new to data analytics and looking to dip their toes in the waters of data science.
More importantly, I hope this repository can help you in your personal and professional journey!

## [Project 1: Improving the Safety of Driving in MA using SQL](https://github.com/jrlemarr/BA775_Project/blob/main/Team%20Assignment-Team-6.ipynb)
- This project focuses on helping the Massachusetts Department of Transportation analyze car accidents. We will analyze the relationship between the frequency and severity of car accidents in relation to various factors, for example time period, road sections, weather conditions and locations. We will try to understand the patterns of car crashes in MA and what actions could be taken by the massDOT to prevent crashes in the future. In addition, we have joined our data with a Covid dataset to find out the influence of Covid on car crashes. After our analysis, suggestions could be made to the massDOT on ways to prevent accidents based on our conclusions.
- Tools: SQL/Tableau/Google Cloud - Jupyter Notebook

## [Project 2: HR Analytics: Job Attrition in Data Scientists](https://github.com/jrlemarr/BA780_Project/blob/main/BA780%20Deliverable%20Finalization.pdf)
- A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who received training. "Company" wants to analyze the factors affecting candiates' decision on staying or looking for a new job after training.
- Tools: Python/Google Colaboratory Notebook

## Project 3: Predicting Members Most Likely Resistant to the COVID Vaccination
- First we predicted Humana members most likely resistant to the COVID vaccination using data provided by Humana with 367 features. Then, we performed exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and implemented LightGBM, Random Forest, and XGBoost models to predict hesitant members. Finally, we recommended targeted plans to drive vaccination among the sub-segments of hesitant members based on data insights. More detailed information regarding the project is confidential due to the nature of the company.

## [Project 4: Drought Impact on Maple Syrup Production](https://github.com/jrlemarr/Capstone_Project/blob/main/Team%20B4%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf)
- This project aims to determine how maple syrup production in gallons is affected by drought and precipitation factors. Our primary focus will be on the Northeast region, precisely seven states, including Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. The New England region is well known for its maple syrup production, and hence we will delve deeper into that area. We will analyze variables such as the annual crop production of maple syrup and other parameters related to climate change.
