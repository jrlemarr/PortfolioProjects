### Business Analytics Portfolio Project Repository

A portfolio of all the projects I have done in regards to data analytics skills.
This repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects I have created, either on my own or as part of team projects.
Please feel free to take these and run with them. Edit them, transform them, make them your own and find your insights and truths.
I hope this serves as a neat guideline to anyone new to data analytics and looking to dip their toes in the waters of data science.
More importantly, I hope this repository can help you in your personal and professional journey!

#### [Project 1: How to Improve the Safety of Driving in MA](https://github.com/jrlemarr/BA775_Project/blob/main/Team%20Assignment-Team-6.ipynb)
- This project focuses on helping the Massachusetts Department of Transportation analyze car accidents. We will analyze the relationship between the frequency and severity of car accidents in relation to various factors, for example time period, road sections, weather conditions and locations. We will try to understand the patterns of car crashes in MA and what actions could be taken by the massDOT to prevent crashes in the future. In addition, we have joined our data with a Covid dataset to find out the influence of Covid on car crashes. After our analysis, suggestions could be made to the massDOT on ways to prevent accidents based on our conclusions.
- Tools: SQL/Tableau/Google Cloud - Jupyter Notebook
