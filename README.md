### Business Analytics Portfolio Project Repository

A portfolio of all the projects I have done in regards to data analytics skills.
This Repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects I have created, either on my own or as part of team projects.
Please feel free to take these and run with them. Edit them, transform them, make them your own and find your own insights and your own truths.
I hope this serves as a neat guideline to anyone who is new to data analytics and is looking to dip his/her toes in the waters of data science.
More importantly, I hope this repository can help you in your personal and professional journey!
